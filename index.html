    <h2 class="text-center"> About the Creator</h2>
    <p class="text-center">
        Hey there, I'm Ara Lee—a spirited second-year undergraduate at UCSD, diving headfirst into the fascinating realm of Cognitive Science with a specialization in Design and Interaction. My roots trace back to New Jersey, but the vibrant energy of Los Angeles, where I grew up with my wonderful family of five, truly feels like home.
    </br>
        Since I was young, creativity has been my constant companion. From doodling in notebooks to tinkering with DIY projects, my hobbies have evolved into a passionate pursuit of skills crucial for my envisioned career path. It's a journey fueled by the desire to merge imagination with tangible outcomes.
    </br>
        Beyond the books and projects, you'll often find me lost in melodies, as music is my daily dose of inspiration. I thrive on the challenge of solving puzzles that tease the mind and find solace in the captivating world of television, where stories transport me to limitless realms of imagination.
    </br>
        Come along with me on this personal expedition where my love for creativity merges seamlessly with the intricate workings of cognition. Together, let's craft innovative solutions and weave compelling designs that resonate deeply.

                <p class="card-text"> For a community project, I partnered up with two other peers to design and create a workbook to teach the alphabet. Our target audience was little kids around the age group of 5-7. The theme of the book is animals that correspond with each letter of the alphabet. Each page has an activity for the kids to do to learn each alphabet letter. We designed the pages through Illustrator and collaborated together on ideas. 

                We printed and produced many copies and donated the books to a local preschool/kindergarten. We also visited them to teach the students the alphabet through the workbook. </p>

                <p class="card-text">These photographs were inspired by the element of water. Water is a natural resource that we use every single day but don’t care for as much as we should. To me, water is mesmerizing and gorgeous just on its own. The ripples it has, the light that reflects when shone through, and just the color can hypnotize. With these photographs, I emphasized the charming allure of water with the help of a friend. </p>

                    I wanted this digital graphics triptych to seem fun and happy at first glance. However, my intention was for the audience to realize a deeper meaning upon closer inspection: the words that are scrambled spell out "depression", "paralysis", and "suffering", offering a new perspective. Overlooked Realities depict the fight between humans, their mental illnesses, and the world. The artwork depicts human figures trying to come out of their bubbles by pushing against the letters which symbolize people fighting against their mental illnesses. Each canvas in the triptych corresponds to a color theme and a specific element of nature that relates to that color: water, fire, and earth that also represent drowning, burning, and strangling which also relates to the horrific impacts that the words represent to humans. I wanted to showcase how there are many people who put up a front to seem fine, therefore many others overlook their mental illness and assume that they're happy without knowing what they are truly going through.  </p>

                <p class="card-text">This piece is a collection of items from several dreams that I have had, all created in Maya. Ever since I was a young girl, I’ve always had the craziest dreams that made absolutely no sense.  However, I was also very fascinated by them. In some dreams, I remembered vague details but in others, I was able to vividly recall all the scenes and emotions. It played like a movie in my head except it was a more intense experience because I felt everything. As weird as some dreams were, it felt like an escape from reality and I wanted to share this. Through this piece, I wanted to reflect on the chaotic nature of those dreams.</p>
